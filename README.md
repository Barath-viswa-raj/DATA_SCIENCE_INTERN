Project Title: Analysis and Price Prediction of Airbnb Listings.
Project Description:

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of Airbnb listings to uncover key insights and build a predictive model for estimating rental prices. The dataset included variables such as property location, number of rooms, amenities, host characteristics, and customer reviews. The project was divided into the following phases:

Data Collection and Cleaning:

Extracted Airbnb listing data from a publicly available dataset.
Performed data cleaning by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing outliers to ensure data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized and analyzed the distribution of important features such as location, price, room types, and availability.
Discovered correlations between variables like location, number of reviews, and amenities with the rental price.
Identified key factors influencing the prices in different areas.
Feature Engineering:

Created new features from the available data, such as average review scores, proximity to tourist attractions, and availability of special amenities (Wi-Fi, kitchen, etc.).
Normalized and encoded categorical variables to prepare the data for machine learning models.
Model Development:

Built multiple machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, to predict Airbnb listing prices.
Fine-tuned model parameters using Grid Search and Cross-Validation techniques to achieve higher accuracy.
Results and Insights:

The Random Forest model provided the best performance with an RÂ² score of [insert value].
Identified that location, property type, and availability of amenities were the most significant factors impacting the price of Airbnb listings.
Delivered insights that could help Airbnb hosts optimize their rental prices based on listing features.
Conclusion:

The project successfully demonstrated the use of data science techniques to analyze and predict Airbnb rental prices.
The insights obtained could be useful for hosts to make data-driven decisions and enhance their competitiveness in the market.
